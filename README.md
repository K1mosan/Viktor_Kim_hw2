Above you can see some photos of my country.

My name is Viktor Kim and I am 23 years old. I came here from small country surrounded high mountains, caleed Kyrgyzstan. Currentlt I study at Fanshawe College on program Interactive Media Design which lasts for 2 years. I am interested in a lot of things from watching movies and TV shows to extreme sports. When I'm not studying or doing anything else, I can stay home, put on a good movie and just relax. I also often invite my friends to go to the countryside, for example to the mountains or other picturesque places, where we take beautiful pictures, talk about everything, cook food and just enjoy the moment. I recently got my driver's license in my home country, so now my plan is to buy a car, get a local license, and drive here.
